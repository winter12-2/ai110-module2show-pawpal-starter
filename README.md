# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## Smarter Scheduling

The PawPal+ system was enhanced with additional algorithms to improve scheduling:

- Sorting tasks by time and priority
- Filtering tasks by completion status
- Basic conflict detection for tasks scheduled at the same time
- Support for recurring tasks (daily)

These features make the scheduling system more intelligent and practical for real-world use.

## Testing PawPal+

Run tests using:

python -m pytest

The test suite verifies:
- Task completion behavior
- Adding tasks to pets
- Sorting tasks by time
- Recurring task generation
- Conflict detection for overlapping tasks

Confidence Level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

When the scheduler detects a conflict, it should be presented as a clear warning message in the UI using components like `st.warning`. The message should highlight which tasks conflict and at what time so the user can easily understand and adjust their schedule. This approach improves usability by providing immediate feedback without interrupting the app flow.
